Among the options provided, **option (I)**—a 50-year-old male with recurrent Dupuytren’s contracture after previous fasciectomy and extensive scarring—best fits this criterion. \n\n**Key Reasoning:**\n1. **Recurrent Disease:** Recurrence after prior surgery is a strong indication for dermatofasciectomy. Full-thickness skin grafting reduces recurrence rates by replacing diseased or scarred skin with healthy grafted tissue, which is resistant to Dupuytren’s proliferation.\n2. **Extensive Scarring:** Previous surgery often leads to scarred, inelastic skin, complicating repeat fasciectomy. Removing the scarred tissue and grafting improves outcomes and reduces contracture recurrence.\n3. **Comparison to Other Options:**\n   - **Option (F)** (severe skin involvement in thumb/index finger) involves significant skin changes, but thumb/index finger involvement is less common, and the description does not emphasize recurrence risk.\n   - **Options (A, B, C, D, E, G, H)** either lack skin involvement, recurrence, or severe risk factors that would necessitate dermatofasciectomy over conventional fasciectomy.\n\n**Conclusion:** Dermatofasciectomy is most beneficial in recurrent cases with scarring, making **(I)** the optimal choice. \n\n**ANSWER: (I)**", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful medical assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Q: For a patient diagnosed with Dupuytren's contracture, in which of the following scenarios would dermatofasciectomy with full-thickness skin grafting be more advantageous compared to conventional fasciectomy?\nAnswer Choices: (A) 40-year-old female stenographer with middle, ring, and small finger involvement including MCP and PIP joints with 50 and 55 degree contractures of ring and small finger MCP joints, respectively (B) 60-year-old male with Dupuytren’s affecting the ring and small fingers, with 30-degree contractures but no skin involvement (C) 48-year-old female with mild Dupuytren’s affecting the ring finger PIP joint and no significant skin changes (D) 45-year-old musician with early-stage Dupuytren’s affecting only the palmar fascia without significant joint involvement (E) 55-year-old construction worker with Dupuytren’s contracture limited to the small finger MCP joint and minimal functional impairment (F) 65-year-old male farmer with severe contractures of the thumb and index finger MCP joints and significant skin involvement (G) 38-year-old male with Dupuytren’s diathesis, including bilateral disease and knuckle pads, but no fixed contractures (H) 65-year-old female golfer with ring and small finger involvement including MCP and PIP joints (I) 50-year-old male with recurrent Dupuytren’s contracture after previous fasciectomy and extensive scarring (J) None of the above as no difference in outcome has been demonstrated between the two procedures\nA: Let's think step by step."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dermatofasciectomy with full-thickness skin grafting is particularly advantageous in scenarios with a high risk of recurrence or significant skin involvement due to Dupuytren’s contracture.
