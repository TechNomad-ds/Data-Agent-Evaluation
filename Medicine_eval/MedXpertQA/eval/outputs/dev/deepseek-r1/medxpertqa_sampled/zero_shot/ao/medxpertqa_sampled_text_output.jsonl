In scenario **I** (50-year-old male with recurrent Dupuytren’s after previous fasciectomy and extensive scarring), the recurrence and scarring indicate aggressive disease. Full-thickness skin grafting helps replace diseased/scarred tissue, reducing recurrence risk—a key advantage over conventional fasciectomy. Other scenarios (e.g., F’s severe skin involvement) may also warrant grafting, but recurrent cases with prior surgery failure strongly align with dermatofasciectomy’s primary indications.", "confidence": [], "prediction": ["I"], "correct": false}
