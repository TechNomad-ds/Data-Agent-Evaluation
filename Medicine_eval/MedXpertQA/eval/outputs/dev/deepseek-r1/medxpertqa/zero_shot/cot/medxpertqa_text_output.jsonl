She reports no changes in vision and has only occasional headaches, which she describes as chronic and stress related.\n\n\nOn physical examination, she has bilateral milky discharge with minimal areolar pressure and no discernible breast mass. Bilateral temporal visual-field defects are noted on visual-field examination.\n\n\nLaboratory testing shows a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 2.4 μU/mL (reference range, 0.5–4.7), a free thyroxine level of 1.4 ng/dL (0.8–1.8), and a prolactin level of 389 ng/mL (0–20).

They reduce prolactin levels, shrink the tumor, and alleviate compressive symptoms in most cases. \n   - **Cabergoline** is preferred due to superior efficacy, tolerability, and dosing convenience compared to bromocriptine. \n4. **Surgery referral (C/G)** is typically reserved for patients with medication resistance, intolerable side effects, or acute/rapidly worsening vision loss. This patient’s stable visual deficits do not mandate urgent surgery.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- **(A) Octreotide:** Used for GH-secreting tumors, not prolactinomas.\n- **(B) Levothyroxine:** Thyroid function is normal (TSH/fT4 within range).\n- **(D/E) Radiotherapy:** Reserved for refractory or residual tumors post-surgery.\n- **(F) Glucocorticoids:** Not indicated here (no adrenal insufficiency or ACTH excess).\n- **(H) Clomiphene:** Fertility may improve with prolactin normalization; no role before addressing hyperprolactinemia.\n\n**Answer: (I) Initiate cabergoline 0.25 mg twice weekly**  \nCabergoline effectively lowers prolactin, shrinks the tumor, and improves symptoms/fertility.
