His medical history includes IV drug use, hepatitis C, atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, obesity, and depression. On examination, his temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient appears fatigued with diffuse jaundice. Cardiopulmonary examination reveals bibasilar crackles, and abdominal examination shows distension, dullness to percussion, a fluid wave, and generalized tenderness. The patient is admitted to the hospital and started on piperacillin-tazobactam. By day 4, he is afebrile, with a pulse of 92/min, reduced abdominal tenderness, and persistent jaundice. Nurses report bleeding from two peripheral IV sites requiring pressure to control, along with new bruises on the patient's arms and legs.
