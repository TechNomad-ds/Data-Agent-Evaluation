{"id": 4, "Right Option": "C", "LLM Response": "The patient presents with slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques on the left upper arm, axilla, and lateral chest. Histopathology reveals thin-walled, irregularly branched blood vessels dissecting through thickened collagen bundles, with plump endothelial cells lacking cytologic atypia. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for CD31 and CD34 (endothelial markers), negativity for HHV-8 (excluding Kaposi sarcoma) and D2-40 (excluding lymphatic origin), and low Ki-67 (<1%) indicating low proliferation. \n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n- **A. Epithelioid hemangioma**: Characterized by epithelioid endothelial cells, often with inflammation. The absence of significant atypia or epithelioid morphology here makes this unlikely.  \n- **B. Morpheaform hemangioma**: Although sclerotic collagen is noted, this entity is less consistently defined and does not align as precisely with the described vascular architecture and immunoprofile.  \n- **C. Microvenular hemangioma (MVH)**: Matches the clinical presentation (slow-growing violaceous plaques) and histopathology (small, thin-walled vessels in sclerotic stroma). CD31/CD34 positivity and D2-40/HHV-8 negativity strongly support this diagnosis.  \n- **D. Tufted angioma**: Typically shows \"cannonball\" clusters of capillaries, absent in this case. The irregularly branched vessels and sclerotic collagen are more indicative of MVH.  \n\nThe findings are classic for **Microvenular hemangioma (MVH)**, making **C** the correct answer. \n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{C}"}
{"id": 3, "Right Option": "C", "LLM Response": "The patient presents with a combination of cutaneous and neurological manifestations, including bluish, keratotic papules on the lower legs (histopathologically confirmed as venous-like malformations) and a history of intracranial hemorrhage, hemiparesis, and seizures. The family history of similar conditions and a heterozygous pathogenic **KRIT1 variant** identified via genetic testing are critical. \n\n**KRIT1** mutations are specifically associated with **Cerebral Cavernous Malformation type 1 (CCM1)**, one of three familial forms of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). The presence of both cutaneous vascular lesions and neurological complications aligns with the systemic nature of familial CCM syndromes. While option **C** (\"Familial cerebral cavernous malformations\") broadly describes the hereditary condition, the genetic test result directly points to **CCM1**, making **D** the most precise diagnosis. \n\n**Final answer:** \\boxed{D}"}
{"id": 2, "Right Option": "B", "LLM Response": "The patient's presentation includes spontaneous bruising, epistaxis, and hematuria, followed by pyrexia and scrotal ulceration with necrotic black eschar during neutrophil recovery. Key findings include negative cultures, neutrophilic inflammation on biopsy, and no evidence of infection or leukemic infiltration. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers often associated with neutrophil recovery and systemic conditions like hematologic malignancies. The biopsy findings (intense neutrophilic inflammation and necrosis) align with PG, while other options—ATRA-induced ulcers (typically non-necrotic and drug-related), Sweet’s syndrome (non-ulcerative plaques), and neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (eccrine gland involvement)—do not fit as well. \n\n\\boxed{A}"}
{"id": 5, "Right Option": "D", "LLM Response": "The teenage girl's presentation includes a left maxillary sinus mass with bone erosion, spindle cells, multinucleated giant cells, and no significant atypia or mitotic activity. Ossifying Fibroma (A) is excluded due to the lack of mineralized tissue and presence of giant cells. Giant cell tumor of bone (B) typically involves long bones and has evenly distributed giant cells, inconsistent with the spindle cell pattern here. Central Giant Cell Granuloma (C) overlaps with Giant Cell Reparative Granuloma (GCRG), but the maxillary location, histology (patternless spindle cells with clustered giant cells), and reactive nature align best with **D**. The absence of atypia and low mitotic activity further support GCRG as the diagnosis.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{D}"}
{"id": 1, "Right Option": "A", "LLM Response": "The patient presents with a congenital scalp lesion showing growth post-trauma, characterized histologically by monomorphic cells forming whorls around collagen bundles, positive for vimentin and EMA (meningioma markers), and negative for other lineage markers (S100, cytokeratins, etc.). Imaging confirms no intracranial or bone involvement. These findings align with **primary cutaneous meningioma**, a benign neoplasm arising from ectopic meningothelial cells in the skin without CNS connection. Key differentiating features include the absence of bone involvement (ruling out meningioma en plaque), the neoplastic whorling pattern (distinguishing from heterotopia), and immunohistochemical profile. The term \"primary\" emphasizes the cutaneous origin, making **B** the most precise diagnosis.\n\n\\boxed{B}"}
