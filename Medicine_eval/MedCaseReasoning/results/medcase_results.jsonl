Dicloxacillin-induced exanthematous drug eruption explained the trunk rash — “…which led to treatment with dicloxacillin, which led to an exanthematous drug eruption.” 3. Nonspecific dermatitis considered but exposure pattern pointed toward a photoreaction — “Differential diagnosis for phototoxic reactions should include all types of nonspecific dermatitis. Ways of approaching the diagnosis include noticing the distribution of the lesions, in that skin under the chin, nose, and other areas may be lesion‐free due to protection from direct sun exposure.”", "llm_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this case. So the patient is a 52-year-old man with Addison's disease, which means he's on lifelong corticosteroids. He presented with redness, burning, and stinging on his right elbow after gardening on a cloudy summer day. Then he developed blisters that ruptured and crusted over. His doctor thought it was cellulitis and gave dicloxacillin, but then he got an itchy rash on his trunk two days later. The exam shows a bright red, edematous, crusted area on the elbow and a maculopapular rash on the trunk. Labs are normal.\n\nFirst, the history of Addison's and steroid use might be important. Steroids can suppress the immune system, making him more susceptible to infections or maybe slower healing. But he was gardening, which makes me think of possible exposure to plants or sunlight. Wait, even though it was cloudy, UV rays can still penetrate, right? So maybe a photosensitivity reaction?\n\nThe initial symptoms after gardening: severe redness, burning, stinging. Then blisters and crusting. That sounds like a burn or severe sunburn. But he was on corticosteroids, which can thin the skin and maybe make him more prone to skin damage. Alternatively, phytophotodermatitis comes to mind. That's when plant chemicals (like psoralens in some plants) make the skin more sensitive to UV light, causing blistering and burns. Plants like limes, celery, parsley, etc. If he was handling such plants while gardening, even on a cloudy day, UV exposure could trigger it.\n\nBut then he took dicloxacillin, and developed a maculopapular rash. That could be a drug reaction. But the initial rash on the elbow was before the antibiotic. Wait, the timeline: he started antibiotics after the elbow symptoms, and two days later got the trunk rash. Maybe the trunk rash is a drug eruption from the dicloxacillin, which is a common antibiotic allergy. But the elbow lesions preceded the antibiotics.\n\nSo the main issue is the elbow lesion. Cellulitis was suspected, but antibiotics didn't help, and labs are normal. Cellulitis usually has elevated WBC or CRP, but here they're normal. So maybe not an infection.\n\nThe combination of gardening with possible plant exposure and UV light makes me think of phytophotodermatitis. The blisters and crusting fit with that. Plus, the patient was on corticosteroids, which could have thinned his skin, making it more susceptible. The cloudy day might have given a false sense of security, but UV rays are still present.\n\nAnother possibility is contact dermatitis, but the blistering and crusting after sun exposure points more towards phytophotodermatitis. Also, the linear or streaky pattern is common in phytophotodermatitis, but the case mentions redness around the elbow, not necessarily streaks. But sometimes it can be patchy.\n\nAlternatively, a chemical burn from plants, but combined with UV, it's more likely phytophotodermatitis. The fact that he was gardening makes exposure to photosensitizing plants possible.\n\nThe trunk rash after antibiotics is likely a separate issue, maybe a drug rash. But the main diagnosis here is the elbow lesion. Since the question is about the most likely diagnosis, I think phytophotodermatitis is the answer here.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nPhytophotodermatitis\n</answer>"}
{"pmcid": "PMC7443985", "final_diagnosis": "Scleroderma_renal_crisis", "diagnostic_reasoning": "1. Scleroderma renal crisis was the leading diagnosis given malignant hypertension and acute kidney injury in a patient with systemic sclerosis after corticosteroid exposure — “Given the sudden change in blood pressure, renal function, proteinuria, and recent exposure to oral corticosteroids, SRC was suspected.” 2. VEGF-blockade–induced thrombotic microangiopathy remained in the differential because intravitreal bevacizumab can cause endothelial injury and TMA — “A complement-mediated TMA related to intravitreal VEGF inhibition could also not be ruled out.”", "llm_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down this case. So, the patient is a 37-year-old man with a 3-month history of skin thickening starting on the torso and spreading. He has weight loss and fatigue. No Raynaud's, dyspnea, or wheezing. Blood pressure is initially 100-110 systolic, which is on the lower side. Creatinine is normal at 0.8. History of treated hepatitis B.\n\nThe serologic tests show negative ANA, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, but positive anti-topoisomerase I (low levels). The nailfold capillaroscopy suggests systemic sclerosis, and the skin biopsy is between morphea and systemic sclerosis. So maybe early scleroderma? Mycophenolate mofetil is started, which is used in systemic sclerosis sometimes.\n\nThen there's an IgG lambda monoclonal protein. Bone marrow shows 10% lambda plasma cells with some cytogenetic abnormalities. Monoclonal gammopathy? Maybe MGUS or smoldering myeloma? But not sure yet. Then he gets high-dose prednisone, which is odd if he has systemic sclerosis. After that, his BP spikes to 140-150, creatinine rises to 1.1, then later up to 1.4 with proteinuria. He gets bevacizumab injections which are anti-VEGF. Then he develops severe hypertension (200s systolic), worsening renal function, proteinuria. Renal ultrasound is normal, so no stenosis. \n\nThey suspect scleroderma renal crisis. But he also had recent VEGF inhibitors. Scleroderma renal crisis typically presents with acute hypertension, renal failure, and maybe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But here, he has the hypertension, renal dysfunction, proteinuria. Also, anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70) is more associated with diffuse systemic sclerosis, which has higher risk for renal crisis. The skin changes progressing also fit. \n\nBut wait, he received bevacizumab, which inhibits VEGF. VEGF inhibitors can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). His symptoms started after the injections. So maybe a VEGF inhibitor-induced TMA? But the initial presentation with skin thickening and anti-Scl-70 points to systemic sclerosis. Could it be both? Or is the renal crisis triggered by steroids? Wait, high-dose steroids can actually precipitate scleroderma renal crisis. Oh right, in systemic sclerosis, steroids can increase the risk of renal crisis. So he was on mycophenolate, then given high-dose prednisone, which could have led to the hypertensive crisis. \n\nThe timeline: skin symptoms for 3 months, then after starting prednisone, BP rises. Then after bevacizumab, BP spikes further with worsening kidneys. The combination of steroids in a scleroderma patient leading to renal crisis, and possibly the anti-VEGF aggravating it via endothelial damage. The renal biopsy is planned, but given the history and presentation, scleroderma renal crisis is the most likely. The presence of anti-Scl-70 supports systemic sclerosis. Plus, the hypertension and renal decline after steroids fits with that scenario. Even though the initial BP was low, steroids could have triggered the crisis. Also, scleroderma renal crisis can present with malignant hypertension and rapid renal failure. \n\nSo the main differentials here are scleroderma renal crisis versus VEGF inhibitor-induced TMA. But given the underlying systemic sclerosis (supported by anti-Scl-70, skin biopsy, capillaroscopy), the use of steroids which are a known trigger, the most probable diagnosis is scleroderma renal crisis. The presence of monoclonal gammopathy might be a red herring, possibly an unrelated MGUS.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nScleroderma renal crisis\n</answer>"}

Ameloblastic fibrosarcoma — “Presence of numerous mitotic cells or any atypical mitosis should suggest malignant entities such as AFS in the differential diagnosis… atypia and mitotic activities were not evident.”", "llm_response": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case. So, the patient is an 18-year-old woman with a slow-growing gingival mass in the left posterior mandible. The key points here are the location, the age of the patient, the slow growth, and the fact that it's painless. The lesion was associated with an impacted third molar, which was excised along with the lesion.\n\nLooking at the radiograph, there's a well-defined radiolucency around the impacted tooth. That makes me think of common lesions associated with impacted molars, like dentigerous cysts or odontogenic tumors. But the histology findings are crucial here. The specimen has both intraosseous and extraosseous parts. Histologically, there are cords and islands of odontogenic epithelium in a myxoid stroma. The epithelial strands are lined by a double layer of cuboidal cells. The islands have peripheral columnar cells with polarized nuclei and central stellate cells, resembling the stellate reticulum. There's juxtaepithelial hyalinization mentioned, which I remember is a feature seen in some odontogenic tumors. No hard tissue formation, so that rules out lesions that produce enamel or dentin, like ameloblastic fibro-odontoma. Also, no cytologic atypia or mitotic figures, suggesting it's benign.\n\nThe description of the epithelial islands with columnar cells and stellate reticulum-like cells makes me think of ameloblastoma. However, the presence of a myxoid mesenchymal stroma with varying cellularity and the fact that there's both intra and extraosseous components might point towards another entity. Ameloblastoma typically has a more fibrous stroma, not myxoid. \n\nWait, another possibility is an odontogenic myxoma. But myxomas usually have a stroma rich in myxoid tissue with scattered odontogenic epithelial remnants, not the organized epithelial islands described here. \n\nThen there's the adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), which often occurs in younger patients, commonly associated with impacted canines, but can sometimes be in the posterior mandible. AOTs have duct-like structures and rosette patterns. Not sure if this fits.\n\nWait, the histology mentions cords and islands of odontogenic epithelium with a double layer of cuboidal cells. The peripheral columnar cells with polarized nuclei and central stellate cells are classic for ameloblastoma. But the stroma being myxoid and cell-rich is a bit conflicting. However, there's a variant called unicystic ameloblastoma, which can be associated with impacted teeth and has a well-defined radiolucency. Unicystic ameloblastoma usually has a single cystic cavity, but maybe this case is a solid/multicystic variant? But the description here doesn't mention a cystic structure.\n\nAlternatively, the stromal characteristics make me think of ameloblastic fibroma. Ameloblastic fibroma has both epithelial and mesenchymal components, with the mesenchymal part being primitive and myxoid. The epithelial component here does have the features of ameloblastoma (columnar cells with reverse polarization), and the stroma is myxoid. Ameloblastic fibroma typically occurs in younger patients, often in the posterior mandible, associated with unerupted teeth. Histologically, it's a biphasic tumor with odontogenic epithelium and a primitive ectomesenchyme. That fits here. Also, the absence of hard tissue formation aligns with ameloblastic fibroma, whereas if there were dentin or enamel, it might be an ameloblastic fibro-odontoma.\n\nAnother thing to consider is odontogenic fibroma, but that's more fibrous stroma with scattered epithelial rests. The description here of the stroma as myxoid and cell-rich leans more towards ameloblastic fibroma. Additionally, juxtaepithelial hyalinization can be seen in ameloblastic fibroma. The lack of cytologic atypia and mitotic figures supports a benign lesion, which ameloblastic fibroma is.\n\nSo putting all this together: young patient, posterior mandible, associated with impacted third molar, histology showing odontogenic epithelial islands in a myxoid mesenchymal stroma, no hard tissue, and benign features. The most likely diagnosis is ameloblastic fibroma.\n\n</think>\n<answer>\nAmeloblastic fibroma\n</answer>"}
