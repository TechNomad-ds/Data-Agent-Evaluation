                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient is a 20-year-old at 12 weeks gestation with absent fetal heart tones and abnormal uterine appearance. The absence of fetal cardiac activity at this gestational age raises immediate concern for non-viable pregnancy (e.g., missed miscarriage or anembryonic gestation) or pathologic conditions like molar pregnancy.  \n<step 2> Hyperemesis gravidarum (daily nausea/vomiting with significant weight loss) is notable. While hyperemesis is common in early pregnancy, severe cases may correlate with elevated hCG levels, as seen in molar pregnancies or multiple gestations. However, multiple gestation is less likely here due to absent heart tones.  \n<step 3> The uterine size (palpable slightly above the pubic symphysis) aligns with 12 weeks, ruling out overt uterine size discrepancies (e.g., large-for-dates uterus in complete molar pregnancy). However, \"abnormal uterine appearance\" suggests structural or imaging findings (e.g., irregular gestational sac, cystic changes).  \n<step 4> Lack of vaginal bleeding or adnexal masses reduces suspicion for ectopic pregnancy or incomplete miscarriage. Minimally tender uterus does not strongly suggest infection (e.g., septic abortion).  \n<step 5> Differential diagnoses include:  \n- **Missed miscarriage**: Absent fetal heart tones with retained products of conception.  \n- **Molar pregnancy**: Hyperemesis, absent fetal heart tones, and potential abnormal uterine imaging (e.g., \"snowstorm\" appearance on ultrasound).  \n- **Anembryonic pregnancy**: Empty gestational sac without embryonic development.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nThe most likely diagnoses are **missed miscarriage** or **molar pregnancy**. Molar pregnancy is supported by severe hyperemesis and absent fetal heart tones, but confirmation requires imaging and hCG correlation. The lack of vaginal bleeding or uterine size discrepancy slightly reduces suspicion for molar pregnancy, though it remains plausible.  \n\n### Additional Information Required:  \n1. **Imaging**: Transvaginal ultrasound to assess gestational sac structure, fetal pole, cardiac activity, and signs of molar changes (e.g., cystic placental changes).  \n2. **Laboratory tests**: Quantitative serum hCG (to evaluate for abnormally elevated levels suggestive of molar pregnancy) and thyroid function tests (hyperthyroidism may accompany molar pregnancy).  \n3. **Pathology**: Histologic examination of products of conception if dilation and curettage (D&C) is performed."

                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The serial beta-hCG levels show a rapid decline (56,857 → 38,070 → 2,642 → 359 mIU/mL over two weeks). This pattern is inconsistent with molar pregnancy, where hCG typically remains elevated or plateaus unless treated. Such a steep drop aligns with resolving pregnancy tissue.  \n<step 2> The initial high hCG (56,857 mIU/mL) at 12 weeks gestation is elevated but not pathologically extreme for a viable singleton pregnancy (normal range at 12 weeks: ~13,300–254,000 mIU/mL). However, the absence of fetal heart tones confirms non-viability.  \n<step 3> The declining hCG trend strongly suggests spontaneous resolution of a non-viable pregnancy (e.g., missed miscarriage or anembryonic gestation) rather than molar pregnancy, which would require intervention to achieve such a rapid hCG normalization.  \n<step 4> While molar pregnancy was initially considered due to hyperemesis and absent fetal heart tones, the lack of ultrasound evidence (e.g., cystic placental changes) and the hCG trajectory make this unlikely.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \nMissed miscarriage (resolved)."
