                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient presents with painless jaundice, a hallmark symptom of pancreatic head malignancy. The imaging finding of a solitary pancreatic head mass strongly supports this suspicion.  \n<step 2> The history of stage II lung adenocarcinoma (poorly differentiated) raises the possibility of metastatic disease. However, solitary pancreatic metastases from lung cancer are rare, and the three-month interval post-surgery is relatively short for metastasis to manifest as a solitary lesion.  \n<step 3> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains the most likely primary diagnosis given the clinical presentation, age, and imaging findings. Painless jaundice with a pancreatic head mass is classic for this malignancy.  \n<step 4> Cholangiocarcinoma or ampullary carcinoma should be considered as alternative causes of obstructive jaundice, though imaging localization to the pancreatic head favors pancreatic origin.  \n<step 5> Autoimmune pancreatitis or benign biliary strictures are less likely but possible differentials; however, these typically present with different imaging features (e.g., diffuse pancreatic enlargement) or clinical clues (e.g., response to steroids), which are not mentioned here.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely diagnosis is **pancreatic adenocarcinoma**, given the painless jaundice and solitary pancreatic head mass. A secondary consideration is **metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma**, though this is less probable due to the rarity of isolated pancreatic metastases and the short post-surgical interval.  \n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen/MRI with MRCP to evaluate mass characteristics (e.g., vascular invasion, ductal dilation) and differentiate pancreatic vs. biliary origin.  \n2. **Biopsy**: EUS-guided FNA or ERCP-guided biopsy for histopathological confirmation and immunohistochemistry (e.g., TTF-1 to assess lung origin vs. pancreatic markers like CK7/CK20).  \n3. **Laboratory tests**: CA 19-9 (elevated in pancreatic cancer), CEA (to assess for metastasis), LFTs (confirm obstructive pattern), and clotting studies.  \n4. **Staging workup**: PET-CT or chest/abdominal CT to rule out disseminated disease, especially given the lung cancer history."

However, biopsy immunohistochemistry shows **TTF-1 positivity** (a lung adenocarcinoma marker) and negativity for pancreatic markers (CA19-9, CK20, p53), strongly favoring metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.  \n<step 2> PET-CT reveals **isolated FDG-avid pancreatic mass** without other metastatic lesions. Given the prior negative PET-CT post-lobectomy, this suggests a solitary metastasis rather than a new primary pancreatic tumor.  \n<step 3> The combination of TTF-1+ adenocarcinoma in the pancreas with a history of poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma confirms metastatic spread. Pancreatic metastases from lung cancer are rare but documented, typically presenting as solitary lesions.  \n<step 4> The absence of other FDG-avid lesions supports this as a solitary metastasis rather than disseminated disease, aligning with the short interval (3 months) since lung surgery.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nMetastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the pancreas."
