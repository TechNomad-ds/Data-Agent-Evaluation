                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient’s rural residency, occupation (cattle/sheep herding), and consumption of raw meat raise suspicion for zoonotic infections. Key considerations include cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* and, less likely, *Taenia solium* (cysticercosis).  \n<step 2> The clinical presentation of a slow-growing, fluctuant, non-tender swelling recurring after incomplete surgical excision strongly aligns with a hydatid cyst. These cysts are notorious for recurrence if not entirely removed or if spillage occurs during surgery.  \n<step 3> Cysticercosis is less probable due to the absence of neurological symptoms (common in neurocysticercosis) and the patient’s exposure to cattle/sheep rather than pigs.  \n<step 4> Alternative diagnoses include benign soft tissue tumors (e.g., lipoma, myxoma) or abscesses. However, the chronic duration, lack of tenderness, and recurrence after surgery make these less likely.  \n<step 5> Soft tissue sarcomas or other malignancies are possible but typically present with firmer masses, rapid growth, or systemic symptoms, which are absent here.  \n\n### Conclusion:\n**Most likely diagnosis**: **Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid cyst)**.  \nSupporting factors: Exposure to livestock, raw meat consumption, recurrent fluctuant swelling post-surgery, and endemicity of *Echinococcus* in rural Ethiopia.  \n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. **Imaging**: Ultrasound/CT/MRI of the swelling to assess for characteristic features (e.g., cystic structure with “water-lily sign” or daughter cysts).  \n2. **Serology**: *Echinococcus* IgG antibody testing (e.g., ELISA, immunoblot).  \n3. **Histopathology**: Review of prior surgical specimen (if available) for hydatid cyst wall or protoscolices.  \n4. **CBC**: Evaluate for eosinophilia (common in parasitic infections)."

The presence of daughter cysts is pathognomonic for *Echinococcus granulosus* infection.  \n<step 2> Lack of bone involvement aligns with the typical presentation of soft tissue hydatidosis, which often affects muscles in endemic regions due to larval dissemination.  \n<step 3> The patient’s rural occupation (livestock herding) and consumption of raw meat further reinforce exposure to *E. granulosus* eggs, commonly transmitted via dog feces contaminating food/water.  \n<step 4> Recurrence after incomplete surgical excision is characteristic of hydatid cysts, as residual cyst components can regenerate. Absence of serology/histopathology does not negate the diagnosis given the highly specific MRI features.  \n\n### Conclusion:\n**Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid cyst)**."
