                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient’s primary complaint is recurrent right-sided chest pain for over two weeks. Given his history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with 60–70% right coronary artery stenosis, cardiac causes like angina or ischemia must be prioritized despite the absence of dyspnea or abnormal cardiopulmonary findings on exam.\n<step 2> Non-cardiac etiologies should also be explored. Musculoskeletal causes (e.g., costochondritis, muscle strain) are plausible due to the unilateral pain and lack of systemic symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or biliary pathology (e.g., cholelithiasis) could present with right-sided chest pain but are less likely without associated GI symptoms.\n<step 3> Pulmonary causes (e.g., pleuritis, pulmonary embolism) are less probable given the absence of cough, fever, or dyspnea, though atypical presentations cannot be entirely excluded.\n<step 4> The worsening pain over two weeks raises concern for unstable angina or progression of CAD. However, stable angina could also explain recurrent pain if triggered by exertion. The absence of physical exam abnormalities does not rule out cardiac ischemia.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely diagnosis is **unstable angina** secondary to progression of pre-existing coronary artery disease. However, musculoskeletal pain and atypical GERD remain plausible differentials. Further testing is required to confirm or exclude cardiac ischemia.\n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. Laboratory tests: Troponin levels to rule out myocardial injury.\n2. Imaging: Repeat coronary angiography or CT angiography to assess stenosis progression; ECG to evaluate for ischemic changes.\n3. Functional testing: Stress test (exercise or pharmacologic) to assess for inducible ischemia.\n4. Additional history: Pain characteristics (exacerbating/alleviating factors, radiation, duration), response to nitroglycerin, recent medication adherence, and risk factors for CAD progression (e.g., smoking, lipid levels)."

Recurrent, worsening chest pain over two weeks aligns with unstable angina, especially given the lack of new imaging or biomarkers to exclude acute coronary syndrome.  \n<step 2> Absence of ancillary test results (ECG changes, troponin levels) prevents confirmation of myocardial injury, but unstable angina does not require biomarker elevation by definition.  \n<step 3> Musculoskeletal pain remains a secondary differential due to the localized nature of pain and absence of systemic symptoms, but cardiac etiology takes precedence given his CAD history.  \n<step 4> No supportive evidence for pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or other non-cardiac causes (e.g., pleuritis, GERD) due to lack of associated symptoms or exam findings.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nUnstable angina (secondary to progression of coronary artery disease)."
