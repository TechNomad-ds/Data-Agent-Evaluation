                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient’s **postprandial left-sided abdominal pain** suggests involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, or mesenteric vasculature. Key considerations include chronic pancreatitis, gastroparesis, or mesenteric ischemia, given the association with meals and weight loss.  \n<step 2> **Diabetes mellitus** raises suspicion for **gastroparesis**, which can cause delayed gastric emptying leading to postprandial pain and vomiting. However, significant weight loss is atypical unless severe malnutrition occurs.  \n<step 3> **Chronic pancreatitis** must be considered, as diabetes can result from pancreatic dysfunction. Postprandial pain (especially after fatty meals) and weight loss align with this diagnosis, though non-tender abdomen is less typical.  \n<step 4> **Mesenteric ischemia** (“intestinal angina”) is plausible due to the patient’s hypertension and diabetes (risk factors for atherosclerosis). Postprandial pain and “food fear” leading to weight loss are classic features, though pain is typically periumbilical.  \n<step 5> **Malignancy** (e.g., gastric, pancreatic, or colonic) is a critical concern due to unexplained weight loss. Left-sided pain could suggest pancreatic body/tail or splenic flexure pathology. Non-tender abdomen does not exclude this.  \n<step 6> **Peptic ulcer disease** is less likely given the absence of epigastric tenderness or overt bleeding, but cannot be ruled out without further testing.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely differentials are **chronic pancreatitis**, **mesenteric ischemia**, or **malignancy** (e.g., pancreatic/gastric cancer). Gastroparesis is possible but less likely to explain weight loss. Insufficient data exists to confirm a definitive diagnosis.  \n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. **Imaging**:  \n   - **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** to evaluate pancreatic morphology, vasculature, or masses.  \n   - **Mesenteric angiography** (CTA or MRA) to assess for arterial stenosis/ischemia.  \n2. **Laboratory tests**:  \n   - **Serum amylase/lipase** (chronic pancreatitis screening).  \n   - **HbA1c** (diabetes control assessment).  \n   - **Tumor markers** (CA19-9, CEA) if malignancy is suspected.  \n3. **Procedures**:  \n   - **Upper endoscopy** to rule out gastric pathology or peptic ulcers.  \n   - **Colonoscopy** if colonic malignancy is suspected.  \n   - **Gastric emptying study** for gastroparesis evaluation."

This location (distal duodenum near the ligament of Treitz) raises suspicion for **submucosal neoplasms** (e.g., gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST], neuroendocrine tumor) or **adenocarcinoma**.  \n<step 2> **Normal upper endoscopy** suggests the lesion may be submucosal or located in a region not easily visualized during routine endoscopy, explaining the discrepancy between imaging and endoscopic findings.  \n<step 3> **Normal tumor markers** (CA19-9, CEA) reduce suspicion for pancreatic or colorectal adenocarcinoma but do not exclude malignancies like GIST or neuroendocrine tumors, which typically do not elevate these markers.  \n<step 4> **Weight loss and postprandial pain** align with a partially obstructive or infiltrative lesion causing mechanical dysfunction or pain due to stretching of the duodenal wall.  \n<step 5> **Negative colonoscopy** and **absence of mesenteric ischemia findings on CT** (no reported vascular stenosis or bowel ischemia) make these diagnoses less likely.  \n\n### Conclusion:\nDuodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or neuroendocrine tumor."
