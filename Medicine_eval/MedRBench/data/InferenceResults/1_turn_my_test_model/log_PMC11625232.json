These findings strongly suggest an infectious or inflammatory process involving the orbit.  \n<step 2> Recent severe nasal congestion and headaches raise suspicion for sinusitis, which is a common precursor to orbital cellulitis due to the anatomical proximity of the ethmoid sinuses to the orbital cavity.  \n<step 3> Differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis (most likely), preseptal cellulitis, sinusitis with orbital extension, and less likely conditions like allergic reactions, dacryocystitis, or cavernous sinus thrombosis.  \n<step 4> Orbital cellulitis is prioritized due to systemic fever (39.5°C), localized warmth, and signs of orbital involvement. Preseptal cellulitis is less likely given the mention of \"orbital inflammation,\" which implies post-septal involvement.  \n<step 5> Cavernous sinus thrombosis is less probable without neurological deficits (e.g., cranial nerve palsies), bilateral symptoms, or altered mental status.  \n\n### Conclusion:\n**Orbital cellulitis secondary to sinusitis** is the most likely diagnosis. This requires urgent evaluation and treatment to prevent complications such as abscess formation, vision loss, or intracranial spread.\n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. Imaging: CT scan of the orbits and paranasal sinuses to confirm orbital involvement, assess for abscess, and evaluate sinus pathology.  \n2. Laboratory tests: Complete blood count (CBC), blood cultures, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR).  \n3. Nasal swab or sinus aspirate (if feasible) for culture to identify causative pathogens (e.g., *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, or anaerobic bacteria)."

The air pocket along the orbital roof suggests possible abscess formation or gas-producing pathogens.  \n<step 2> Markedly elevated CRP, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia confirm a severe bacterial infection. These findings align with complications of untreated or aggressive orbital cellulitis.  \n<step 3> The presence of frontal epidural empyema indicates intracranial spread, likely secondary to orbital cellulitis originating from bacterial sinusitis (left maxillary sinus involvement).  \n<step 4> The absence of nasal swab/sinus aspirate cultures limits pathogen identification, but the clinical and radiographic progression confirms a polymicrobial or aggressive bacterial etiology (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus* species, or anaerobes).  \n\n### Conclusion:\n**Orbital cellulitis with intracranial epidural empyema secondary to acute bacterial sinusitis.**"
