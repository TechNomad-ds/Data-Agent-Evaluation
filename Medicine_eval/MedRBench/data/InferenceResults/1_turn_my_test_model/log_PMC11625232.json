                "answer": "### Chain of Thought:\n<step 1> The patient presents with severe left eye pain, eyelid edema, erythema, localized warmth, and high fever (39.5°C). These signs strongly suggest an infectious or inflammatory process involving the orbit or periorbital structures. The presence of orbital inflammation (e.g., proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or vision changes, though not explicitly stated) further supports orbital involvement rather than isolated preseptal cellulitis.\n\n<step 2> The recent severe nasal congestion and headaches raise suspicion for sinusitis, particularly ethmoid sinusitis, which is a common precursor to orbital cellulitis due to anatomical proximity. Orbital cellulitis often develops secondary to sinus infection spreading through the thin medial orbital wall.\n\n<step 3> Differential diagnoses include orbital cellulitis, preseptal cellulitis, and complications of sinusitis (e.g., subperiosteal abscess). Orbital cellulitis is prioritized due to systemic symptoms (fever), orbital inflammation, and sinus-related complaints. Preseptal cellulitis typically lacks orbital signs but shares overlapping features like eyelid edema and erythema. A subperiosteal abscess would require imaging for confirmation.\n\n<step 4> The absence of trauma or foreign body history reduces suspicion for mechanical injury or localized infection (e.g., conjunctivitis). However, the lack of explicit details about visual acuity, extraocular movements, or pupillary reflexes limits definitive exclusion of other pathologies.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely diagnosis is **orbital cellulitis secondary to bacterial ethmoid sinusitis**, given the triad of fever, orbital inflammation, and sinus involvement. Urgent imaging and empiric antibiotics are warranted to confirm and manage this condition.\n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. Imaging: Contrast-enhanced CT of orbits and sinuses to assess for orbital involvement, sinus opacification, or abscess formation.\n2. Laboratory tests: CBC, CRP, blood cultures.\n3. Ophthalmologic evaluation: Visual acuity, extraocular movement assessment, pupillary reflexes, and fundoscopy."

However, based on the available ancillary test results, a non-contrast CT (NCCT) scan was performed, which showed thickened, inhomogeneous left orbital and periorbital tissue; air pocket along the orbital roof; inflammatory obliteration of the left maxillary sinus; and a small frontal epidural empyema.\n\n2. Laboratory tests: \n   Based on the available ancillary test results, laboratory findings show elevated CRP (306.9 mg/L), leukocytosis (15.30 × 10^3/µL), and neutrophilia (13.16 × 10^3/µL).

These findings confirm severe orbital inflammation and intracranial involvement (epidural empyema), indicating a complication of sinusitis with contiguous spread. The air pocket suggests possible gas-forming infection or abscess formation.\n\n<step 2> Elevated CRP (306.9 mg/L), leukocytosis (15.30 × 10³/µL), and neutrophilia (13.16 × 10³/µL) confirm a systemic bacterial infection. The absence of blood cultures limits identification of the pathogen but does not alter the urgency of treatment.\n\n<step 3> The combination of orbital cellulitis (from sinusitis) and frontal epidural empyema indicates **intracranial extension of infection**. The frontal epidural empyema likely originates from direct spread of sinusitis (e.g., via venous thrombophlebitis or osteomyelitis) or hematogenous seeding. This is a life-threatening complication requiring immediate intervention.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**Orbital cellulitis with intracranial complication (frontal epidural empyema) secondary to acute bacterial sinusitis.**"
