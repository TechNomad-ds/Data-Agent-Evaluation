Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain with hypotension and tachycardia suggests an acute abdominal catastrophe.\n<step 2> Key differentials include mesenteric ischemia (high risk due to vascular disease from hypertension/diabetes), perforated viscus (possible antibiotic-associated complications or stress ulcer), or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) given age and hypertension. \n<step 3> Hypotension and tachycardia align with systemic shock, which could result from sepsis (e.g., perforation with peritonitis) or hypovolemia (e.g., hemorrhage from AAA rupture or ischemic bowel).\n<step 4> The absence of abdominal exam details (e.g., rigidity, distension, pulsatile mass) limits specificity. Imaging (CT abdomen/pelvis) is critical to evaluate for ischemia, perforation, or AAA. Laboratory tests (lactate, WBC, amylase) and imaging would clarify the diagnosis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely diagnoses are **mesenteric ischemia**, **perforated viscus**, or **ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm**, given the acute presentation and risk factors. Urgent imaging and labs are required to confirm.\n\n### Additional Information Required:\n1. Imaging: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (if renal function permits) to assess for ischemia, perforation, or AAA.\n2. Laboratory tests: Serum lactate, CBC, amylase/lipase, and blood cultures.\n3. Physical exam details: Abdominal tenderness localization, rigidity, pulsatile mass, or bowel sounds."
