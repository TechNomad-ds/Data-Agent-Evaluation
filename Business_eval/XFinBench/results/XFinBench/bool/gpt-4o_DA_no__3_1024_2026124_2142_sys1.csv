1,1,vali_1,bool,"Consider the difference between a total return swap and an asset swap.In a total return swap, the bond's promised payments are swapped for LIBOR plus a spread.",,0.0,,TU,term_2649,"In a total return swap, one party agrees to pay the total return (interest payments plus capital gains or losses) of a financial asset, such as a bond, to another party in exchange for regular payments based on an agreed fixed or floating rate, typically LIBOR plus a spread. 

However, the statement mentions ""[...] the bond's promised payments are swapped for LIBOR plus a spread,"" which might suggest that only the bond's interest payments are swapped rather than the entire total return including capital gains or losses. This could be a misleading simplification as the whole asset return, not only its promised payments, is a part of the transaction.

Therefore, my answer is the statement is false because it oversimplifies what is exchanged in a total return swap by focusing solely on the promised payments instead of the entire bond's return.",0,0,0,2026-01-24 21:42:49.685186

Moral hazard can still exist even in scenarios where there is no asymmetry of information between a borrower and a lender. Moral hazard arises when a party has an incentive to take on more risk because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions. Even if both parties have the same information, the borrower may still engage in riskier behavior compared to what was initially agreed upon due to increased risk tolerance spurred by, for example, insurance coverage or anticipated bailouts.",0,0,0,2026-01-24 21:42:52.462697
6,6,vali_6,bool,"In the primitive economy of cavemen, there was minimal need for trade.Cavemen did not need money due to the lack of specialization in producing one type of good.",,1.0,,TU,term_938,"Cavemen lived in an environment where their primary activities were hunting, gathering, and survival. In such societies, specialization—where individuals focus on producing a specific type of good—was minimal or non-existent. Most resources were shared within the community, and any trade that may have occurred would likely have been based on simple barter or informal exchanges rather than involving currency. Hence, money was unnecessary because the societal structure focused on direct survival needs rather than specialized production and trade.

7,7,vali_7,bool,Consider the role of financial markets in the economy.Financial markets are important to the health of the economy because they channel funds from people who have a productive use for them to people who do not.,,0.0,,TU,term_1881,"The statement is false. 

Financial markets are actually crucial to the economy primarily because they channel funds from individuals or entities that have surplus funds (savers) to those who have productive uses for them (borrowers, businesses, etc.). In other words, financial markets allow those who need money for productive purposes (such as investments in businesses, projects, or assets) to access it from those who have excess funds. This facilitates economic growth and development through efficient allocation of resources.

Therefore, my answer is false. Financial markets channel funds to people who have a productive use for them, not the other way around.",0,0,0,2026-01-24 21:42:55.713909

A market-if-touched order, also known as a ""market to limit"" order, is executed at the best available price after the market reaches the specified price. It is designed to buy or sell once the security crosses the specified trigger price, but unlike a stop order, it does not continue to execute at a less favorable price once the initial condition is met. In a market-if-touched order, once the security hits the specified price, the order is converted into a market order and executed at the best available price.

On the other hand, a stop order, typically called a stop-loss order, is designed to limit an investor's loss on a position. Once the stop price is reached, the stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the next available price, which could be less favorable than the specified stop price, especially in volatile market conditions.",0,0,0,2026-01-24 21:42:57.346952

If the Phew Charitable Trust already pays no taxes on its capital gains, dividend income, or interest income, it would not gain any additional tax advantage from holding municipal bonds, which are typically purchased for their tax-exempt status. Holding municipal bonds would not provide an additional benefit beyond what the trust is already experiencing due to its tax-exempt status.",0,0,0,2026-01-24 21:42:59.570288
13,13,vali_13,bool,"A total return swap can be used as a financing tool.In the event of a default by the company, the financial institution does not own the assets.",,0.0,,TU,term_2649,"Total return swaps are a type of derivative that can be used for various purposes, including hedging, investment, and financing. In a total return swap, one party (the total return payer) makes payments to another party (the total return receiver) based on the total return of an underlying asset, which includes both income and capital gains/losses. In exchange, the total return receiver makes payments to the payer, typically based on a fixed or floating rate interest.

Regarding the ownership of assets in the event of a default, a total return swap is a financial derivative and does not involve actual ownership of the underlying asset by the financial institution. Instead, the swap is a contract through which the financial institution (often the total return receiver) gains exposure to the asset without owning it. Therefore, if the company defaults, the financial institution does not have ownership rights over the assets related to the swap contract unless there are specific clauses or collateral arrangements within the broader terms of the contract.

This implies that the dividend growth rate is supposed to match the capital gains yield. In this model, the capital gains yield (or growth in stock price) is derived from the growth rate of dividends. Therefore, in the context of the dividend growth model, the growth rate in dividends and the capital gains yield are typically the same, not different.

However, the reason given—regarding the placement accommodating large urban populations—is not necessarily accurate. At the time of the Federal Reserve System's establishment, several factors such as geographic centrality, economic diversity, the presence of significant financial entities, and political considerations were taken into account. Missouri's two cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, were strategically chosen due to their economic significance and geographic convenience across the region rather than specifically due to demands from large urban populations.

24,24,vali_24,bool,Suppose a project has conventional cash flows and a positive NPV.The IRR must be greater than the required return.,,1.0,,TU; TR,term_496,"To determine whether the statement is true or false, let's break it down:

- Conventional cash flows refer to a pattern where you have an initial outflow followed by a series of inflows.
- NPV (Net Present Value) is positive when the present value of cash inflows exceeds the present value of cash outflows.
- IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is the discount rate at which the NPV of a project becomes zero.
- The required return is essentially the hurdle rate, the minimum rate of return necessary to justify an investment.

Given these definitions, if a project has conventional cash flows and a positive NPV, it indicates that the IRR, which sets the NPV to zero, must be greater than the required return. This is because at the required return, the NPV is already positive. Only if the IRR is above the required rate of return can the NPV be positive.

28,28,vali_28,bool,"Consider the difference between a total return swap and an asset swap.In an asset swap, the bond's promised payments are swapped for LIBOR plus a spread.",,1.0,,TU,term_2649,"The statement is partially true when it refers to asset swaps. In an asset swap, the fixed coupon payments of a bond are indeed typically exchanged for floating rate payments, often LIBOR plus a spread. This allows the holder to synthetically convert fixed rate bonds into floating rate bonds according to their preferences or market conditions.

However, the statement does not distinguish between other aspects of a total return swap and an asset swap. In a total return swap, the total economic performance of an asset, including income from the asset and any capital gains or losses, is exchanged between the parties, typically against LIBOR plus a spread. Thus, a total return swap involves more than just the coupon payments and can include capital gains or losses, whereas an asset swap focuses only on swapping the interest rate basis.
