    "question": "What are the three components of Airborne Infection Control (AIC) defined by the National AIC guidelines?",
    "answer": "The three components of Airborne Infection Control are: 1. Administrative (Managerial), 2. Environmental, and 3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the primary focus of the 'Guide on Airborne Infection Control For Health infrastructure planners & implementers'?",
    "answer": "This document focuses on environmental control, specifically ventilation, to reduce the risk of transmission of airborne pathogens like Tuberculosis (TB) in health care settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the three broad types of ventilation described in the guide?",
    "answer": "The three types are: 1. Natural ventilation (using natural forces like wind and buoyancy), 2. Mechanical ventilation (using fans/air handlers), and 3. Hybrid or Mixed ventilation (combining both)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the formula for calculating Air Changes per Hour (ACH)?",
    "answer": "ACH = (CFM x 60 min) / Volume of the room. (Where CFM is Cubic Feet per Minute)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended range of Air Changes per Hour (ACH) for health care facilities?",
    "answer": "The AIC recommendations for air exchange in health care facilities is 6-12 air changes per hour (ACH)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are sliding windows not recommended for natural ventilation in health care facilities?",
    "answer": "Sliding windows are not recommended because they cut the effective ventilation opening area by 50%. Windows should be outward or inward opening (hinged) to allow 100% utilization of the inlet."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'stack effect' or 'chimney effect' in ventilation?",
    "answer": "The stack effect is the movement of air into and out of buildings resulting from air buoyancy, which occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density caused by temperature and moisture differences."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the seating arrangement be designed in waiting areas to minimize infection risk?",
    "answer": "Seats should be installed facing away from each other to prevent cross-infection. Overcrowding should be avoided, potentially by providing additional seating in outside shaded areas."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended design for internal partition walls to ensure air circulation?",
    "answer": "Internal walls should be of lesser height than the ceiling, leaving a gap of at least 60 cm between the wall and the ceiling to allow air to circulate while maintaining privacy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should false or dropped ceilings be avoided in these facilities?",
    "answer": "False ceilings reduce the effective height of the room and restrict the rise of warm, potentially infected air, preventing it from escaping through high-level ventilators."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the ideal direction of airflow relative to the Health Care Worker (HCW) and the patient?",
    "answer": "The air should flow from the Health Care Worker (HCW) towards the patient, or sideways between them, to ensure that potentially infectious air from the patient does not flow towards the HCW."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are 'transoms' and why are they important?",
    "answer": "Transoms (or ventilators) are openings provided above doors and windows. They should be kept open to allow warm, infected air to escape the room, facilitating fresh air replacement."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the minimum recommended clear height for rooms to aid ventilation?",
    "answer": "The height of the rooms must be a minimum of 3 meters clear or more to enhance the dilution of air."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended ratio of opening area to floor area for natural ventilation?",
    "answer": "The total area of openings (doors and windows) per room should be equal to or exceed 20% of the floor area of that room."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is an 'Outside Waiting area' beneficial for infection control?",
    "answer": "An outside waiting area allows for the free flow of natural air, which dilutes potentially infected air, making it less infectious and reducing the risk of airborne transmission compared to enclosed indoor spaces."
