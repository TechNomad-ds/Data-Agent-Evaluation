      "question": "What are the three main components of Airborne Infection Control according to the National AIC guidelines?",
      "answer": "According to the National AIC guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (2010), the three main components of Airborne Infection Control are: Administrative/Managerial controls, Environmental controls, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of environmental controls in Airborne Infection Control?",
      "answer": "The primary purpose of environmental controls in Airborne Infection Control is to dilute infected air with fresh air through effective ventilation, remove infected air and replace it with fresh air, and/or decontaminate infected air through methods like filtration and ultra violet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the three broad types of ventilation described in the document?",
      "answer": "The three broad types of ventilation described in the document are: Natural ventilation (using natural forces like wind and buoyancy), Mechanical ventilation (using mechanical fans/air handlers), and Hybrid or Mixed ventilation (combining both natural and mechanical methods)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is natural ventilation considered advantageous for healthcare settings in the context of infection control?",
      "answer": "Natural ventilation is considered advantageous for healthcare settings because it is the simplest and most cost-effective way to ventilate health care spaces to reduce transmission risk. It provides fresh air inexpensively, is easily implementable, and can achieve large numbers of air exchanges. Unlike mechanical and hybrid ventilation, it doesn't require complex design, correct installation, or ongoing maintenance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two types of natural ventilation that occur in buildings?",
      "answer": "The two types of natural ventilation that occur in buildings are: Wind-driven ventilation (happens due to pressure differences created by wind surrounding a structure and the openings on the façade) and Buoyancy-driven ventilation (occurs due to directional buoyancy force resulting from temperature differences between interior and exterior)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recommended air exchange rate for health care facilities according to AIC recommendations?",
      "answer": "The AIC recommendations for air exchange in health care facilities is 6-12 air changes per hour (ACH)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can Air Changes per Hour (ACH) be calculated?",
      "answer": "Air Changes per Hour (ACH) can be calculated using the formula: ACH = (CFM x 60 min) / Volume of the room, where CFM is the cubic feet per minute of airflow. To calculate CFM, the average velocity of airflow (measured in feet per minute) is multiplied by the size of the opening in square feet."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the minimum percentage of openings (windows/doors) recommended in healthcare rooms relative to floor area?",
      "answer": "The total amount of openings (windows/doors) per room should be equal to or exceed 20% of the area of the room to ensure maximum dilution of air."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are sliding windows not recommended for healthcare facilities?",
      "answer": "Sliding windows are not recommended for healthcare facilities because they cut ventilation by 50%. Instead, windows should open on hinges (outward or inward opening) to allow for 100% utilization of the inlet for air flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recommended minimum height for rooms in healthcare facilities according to the document?",
      "answer": "The height of the rooms must be a minimum of 3 meters (3M) clear or more to help for better dilution of air in the room."
    },
    {
      "question": "What design feature should be included above doors and windows in healthcare facilities?",
      "answer": "Ventilators or transoms should be provided above doors and windows. These ventilators help the infected warm air to escape the room, allowing that space to be filled with fresh air from the windows and doors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recommended design for internal walls in healthcare facilities to maximize air circulation?",
      "answer": "The internal walls of rooms in healthcare facilities should be of lesser height than the ceiling height to maximize air circulation, with a gap of at least 60 cms between the top of the partition and the ceiling. The partition should still be high enough to protect privacy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should false or dropped ceilings be avoided in healthcare facilities?",
      "answer": "False or dropped ceilings should be avoided because they reduce the effective height of the space and restrict the rise of warm air. This impedes the proper ventilation needed to remove potentially contaminated air through ventilators or exhausts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should patient seating be arranged in waiting areas to reduce infection risk?",
      "answer": "Patient seating in waiting areas should avoid overcrowding, with additional seating provided outside using a number system. Seats should be installed facing away from each other to prevent cross infection amongst patients. Patients should not be permitted to stand at the entrance to waiting areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the recommended position for healthcare workers relative to patients and airflow?",
      "answer": "The positioning of healthcare workers in a room should allow air to flow from the healthcare worker to the patient so that potentially infectious air from a patient coughing or sneezing does not infect the healthcare worker. If this arrangement is not possible, a compromise would be to arrange the healthcare worker's table/desk parallel to the air flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should sputum collection be conducted in a healthcare facility?",
      "answer": "An open, outdoor, well-ventilated, safe area should be designated for sputum collection. If collocated with other facilities, a separate entry/exit should be provided to avoid contact with OPD patients, or it should be in a separate area away from other facilities. In case of lack of adequate space, it should be provided at the exit of the facility."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of windows should be used in naturally ventilated areas of healthcare facilities?",
      "answer": "The windows in naturally ventilated areas of healthcare facilities should be made outward or inward opening type, NOT sliding type. This ensures that the openings provided are utilized optimally for ventilation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it stated that undiagnosed TB patients pose the highest risk of transmission?",
      "answer": "Undiagnosed TB patients pose the highest risk of transmission because they are not yet identified as having TB and therefore no specific infection control measures have been implemented to prevent them from spreading the disease. They may be coughing and releasing infectious particles in waiting areas and other common spaces, potentially exposing many others before their condition is recognized."
    },
    {
      "question": "What organization collaborated with MCGM to provide technical assistance for airborne infection control in Mumbai?",
      "answer": "In 2016, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and SHARE India (a Hyderabad-based NGO) to provide technical assistance to build institutional capacity to strengthen airborne infection control practices in health care institutions in Mumbai."
