    },
    {
      "question": "What airflow direction is recommended within the building layout?",
      "answer": "Air should ideally flow from non-infectious areas toward areas more likely to have infectious patients (e.g., waiting rooms, OPD, medicine wards) to reduce circulation of potentially infectious air in cleaner areas."

    {
      "question": "What corridor design is recommended to support natural ventilation?",
      "answer": "A single corridor connecting rooms with multiple large windows opening both to the exterior and to rooms, avoiding sliding windows, so wind can enter and dilute room air."

    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the guide recommend using outside waiting areas when available?",
      "answer": "Outdoor areas provide free airflow that dilutes potentially infected air, reducing airborne transmission risk among waiting patients; certain activities can be extended outdoors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are sliding window panels discouraged, and what is recommended instead?",
      "answer": "Sliding panels cut ventilation by about 50%; hinged windows that open inward or outward are recommended to allow full utilization of the air inlet."

    },
    {
      "question": "What does the guide caution about grills, glass partitions, and dense wire mesh at openings?",
      "answer": "Grills may be used to stop animals while allowing airflow, but solid partitions like glass and dense wire mesh should be avoided because they obstruct air and light."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should internal wall partitions be designed to maximize air circulation?",
      "answer": "Partitions should be lower than the ceiling, leaving a gap of at least 60 cm between partition top and ceiling while still protecting privacy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the guide recommend regarding ceiling height and false ceilings?",
      "answer": "Ceilings should be as high as possible to help warm contaminated air rise and exit; false/dropped ceilings should be avoided, and if they already exist some panels should be opened."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should seating be arranged in waiting areas to reduce infection risk?",
      "answer": "Avoid overcrowding, add seating outside using a number system, do not allow standing at entrances, and install seats facing away from each other to reduce cross infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should healthcare workers be positioned relative to airflow in facility rooms?",
