# Foreword

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health concern in our country. Drug Resistant (DR) TB became a major problem in Mumbai in 2012 causing the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to address the issue. Infection control was identified as one of the crucial preventive strategies to reduce DR TB transmission as a part of Mumbai Mission for TB Control.

In 2016, the MCGM collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and SHARE India; a Hyderabad based Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to provide technical assistance to build institutional capacity to strengthen airborne infection control (AIC) practices in health care institutions in Mumbai. In this context, an AIC unit trained by CDC was set up in the MCGM as a pilot project to implement effective airborne infection control policies and has been working in the health facilities of MCGM since the last two years.

The Guide on AIC for Health infrastructure planners and implementers has taken shape with extensive research and compilation of MCGM AIC team in field, available scientific data and publications of WHO and CDC. The National AIC guidelines, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2010 defines the three components of AIC: Administrative, Environmental and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

This document focuses on environmental control in relation to airborne infection control in various health care settings. It provides technical and operational guidance on environmental controls to reduce the risk of transmission of airborne pathogens. Although much of the document pays attention on TB as the prototypic disease of airborne transmission, they are applicable to other respiratory infections as well.

This document is intended for use by Health implementers and Planners of MCGM and must be implemented by all the authorities involved in planning, executing and construction of health structures in MCGM. This document will be a useful guide in designing and considering retrofit designing of health institutes in MCGM and will help in preventing transmission of TB.

It is imperative to bring these into action for our fight against TB towards its elimination.

# 1. Background

Airborne diseases can spread from one person to another when a person with the disease releases infectious particles when coughing, sneezing or talking. These particles can spread through the air, and be transmitted to and infect other people causing disease. Tuberculosis disease is an airborne infectious disease and a major public health concern. One person with active pulmonary tuberculosis can transmit the bacteria and infect household members as well as those s/he works with.

WHO has recommended a set of interventions to reduce the spread of airborne infections and the Indian National Guidelines include these as well.

# Administrative/Managerial:

These are measures to be implemented by the administrator of the health institute to in charge. These measures include fast tracking of coughing patients, segregation of infected patients, providing cough guidance, regulating the process flow within the institutes to avoid overcrowding in congested places to reduce transmission from the infected to the non-infected attendees.

# Environmental:

The second line of control constitutes environmental measures which range from simple and inexpensive to technically complex and resource intensive. Environmental controls rely on some basic principles like:

Dilution of the infected air with fresh air (achieved through effective ventilation)  Removal of the infected air- which will then be replaced by fresh air and/ or  Decontamination of the infected air by various methods including but not limited to; filtration which effectively removes active TB bacteria from the air and the use of ultra violet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) which disables the organisms ability to reproduce.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): These include measures to be taken by health care professionals like using N 95 respirators, promoting safe practices like hand hygiene and following standard operating laboratory procedures.

# The purpose of this document is twofold:

 To understand the importance of design elements with respect to Airborne Infection Control.   
 To describe various methods of ventilation: natural, mechanical, hybrid and how natural ventilation can be optimally utilized in building design of health institutes.

This guidance document is for Architects and Engineers to provide basic information about methods of reducing the risk of airborne infections in health care settings. Although much of the document pays attention to TB as the prototypic disease of airborne transmission but they are applicable to other respiratory infections as well.

Architects & Engineers play a vital role in detailing the design and planning of any structure. It is important that the AIC concepts be understood so that renovation and designing of new Health institutes will be done within the context of Airborne Infection Control.

# 2. Environmental Controls

Environmental controls include ventilation, UVGI, filtration and other methods of air cleaning. This section will focus on ventilation and its types.

# Ventilation

The Merriam Webster dictionary defines Ventilation as “the circulation of air”, “a system or means of providing fresh air”. The introduction of fresh air into a room is needed to replace stale, infectious or noxious air. Ventilation can be of three broad types based on the method of bringing in fresh air and removing the stale air.

# I. Natural ventilation

Natural forces such as winds and buoyancy formed due to the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor air, density differences, etc., push the outdoor air through “purpose-built” openings that are made in the outer façade of the building. These “purpose-built” openings are windows, doors, solar chimneys, wind towers, etc. The effectiveness of natural ventilation is ultimately determined by local climate of the area, design of the building and behaviour of the users.

# II. Mechanical Ventilation

Mechanical ventilation is typically described by the use of mechanical fans/air handlers to move and/or condition(heat and cool) air within the structure. Properly designed and installed mechanical ventilation for healthcare settings involves dedicated air handlers providing single pass supply and exhaust airflow. This directional airflow is critical in control of transmission of infectious particles such as the TB bacillus. These dedicated systems are also the only way to provide effective filtration for the removal of infectious organisms. Climate plays a major influence in determining the type of mechanical ventilation to be used in a given situation. Mechanical ventilation may be the best method of Airborne Infection Control in high risk health care settings when natural ventilation cannot be provided. However, design, installation, and especially MAINTENANCE are critical for long term success. Mechanical ventilation is therefore a very costly solution to the AIC challenge.

# III. Hybrid or Mixed Ventilation

Hybrid or mixed-mode ventilation depends on both natural wind forces to provide the desired flow rate, when the natural ventilation flow rate is too low, uses mechanical ventilation to reduce risk. When natural ventilation alone is not suitable, exhaust fans (as per design need) can be installed to increase ventilation.

# 3. Natural Ventilation

Natural ventilation is the simplest and most cost effective way to ventilate health care spaces to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious particles. Providing fresh air is inexpensive and easily implementable, and large numbers of air exchanges can be achieved. Mechanical ventilation and Hybrid ventilation are more costly and knowledge dependent methods of ventilation because of the need to design properly, install correctly, MAINTAIN FOREVER

# Types of natural ventilation

Two types of natural ventilation occur in buildings:

 Wind driven ventilation: This type of ventilation happens due to the difference in pressure created by wind surrounding a structure and the openings formed on the façade (windows and doors), which then helps the air to flow through the building.   
 Buoyancy-driven ventilation: This occurs as a result of the “directional buoyancy force” that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior

There are various methods to maximise natural ventilation like single sided ventilation, cross ventilation, stack ventilation, wind catchers and solar induced ventilation.

# II. Elements of Ventilation

Building Ventilation has the following basic elements:

Ventilation rate —it is the amount and quality of outdoor air that is provided into the space. The ventilation flow rate can be referred to as either an absolute ventilation flow rate in $1 / s \ \mathrm { o r } \ \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } / s ,$ , or an air-change rate relative to the volume of the space per hour The AIC recommendations for air exchange in health care facilities is 6-12 air changes per hour (ACH).   
 Airflow direction — the prevailing direction from which air flows into a building

 Air distribution or airflow pattern — ideally the fresh air coming in from the openings should be delivered to every corner of the inside space to insure that that airborne pollutants and infectious particles are removed in an efficient way.

# III. Assessing Ventilation

Ventilation performance in buildings can be evaluated addressing the following:

Does the system provide sufficient ventilation rate as required?

Is the overall airflow direction in a building from clean to dirty zones (e.g. isolation rooms or laboratory to outside)?

How efficient is the system in delivering the outdoor air to each location in the room?

How efficient is the system in removing the airborne pollutants from each location in the room?

# IV. Air Changes per Hour (ACH)

An air change can be defined as the number of times the air enters and exits a room from the openings (in natural ventilation) or HVAC system (in mechanical ventilation) in one hour, the number of times the entire volume of a room will fill up with the air from the supply point in sixty minutes.

The air changes per hour (ACH) can be calculated with the use of the following formula:

# Air changes per hour $=$ CFM x 60 min Vol. of the room

To calculate the volume of airflow in an ACH calculation, VELOCITY of airflow must be measured. Velocity can be measured using sophisticated instruments such as a hot-wire anemometer or something as simple as a Vaneometer. This velocity measurement should be made in several places in the opening (taking 4 – 8 readings depending on size) and these readings are then averaged. The velocity will be typically expressed in feet (or meters) per second and must be converted to FPM feet per minute. This average velocity measurement is then multiplied by the size of the opening (in square feet or sq. meters). This product is the volume of airflow through the opening in cubic feet (or

meters) minute CFM. To calculate the ACH, this CFM value has to be changed into CFH (Cubic feet per Hour), by multiplying it by 60 minutes. This value is then divided by the volume of the room in cubic feet unit to obtain the Air Changes per Hour.

For Example, if the volume of air entering the room is $3 0 0 ~ \mathrm { c f m }$ , and the dimensions of the room are $\phantom { - } 1 5 \times 2 0 \times 8$ ) ft., then the air changes per hour would be   
ACH (Air Changes per Hour) $=$ (300 cfm X 60 min.)/ (15 X 20 x 8)   
ACH (Air Changes per Hour) $= 1 8 0 0 0 / 2 4 0 0$   
ACH (Air Changes per Hour) $= 7 . 5$   
Thus the air changes per hour in the room of size $[ 1 5 \mathrm { X } 2 0 \mathrm { X } 8 $ ) ft would be 7.5 with 300 CFM of air entering into the room.

# 4. Design Considerations

This section will focus on design concepts, site planning and building geometry of naturally ventilated structures.

# I. Design Concepts

When developing the design concept for a naturally ventilated building for airborne infection control purposes, the conditions of the site, such as prevailing winds are key determinants of overall efficacy of ventilation. There are three basic steps involved.

Step 1: Outline the desired pattern of airflow starting from the inlet or openings to the outlets. This provides a framework for allocating the best location of various spaces according to the airflow. Then organize the internal and external spaces such as specific rooms and corridors depending on the intended use of the rooms.

Step 2: Categorize the key available forces that allow the preferred airflow pattern that is to be attained. Effective approaches for infection control are dependent upon the wind. A mixed wind-driven and stack-driven airflow can be considered wherever necessary and feasible. Stack effect or chimney effect is the movement of air into and out of buildings, or chimneys resulting from air buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. Advantage of stack ventilation is that the temperature differentials are generally consistent throughout the year and available to use in many climates. The primary disadvantage is the expertise required to properly design stack effect ventilation. Design considerations such as where the “make-up” air comes from and where “exhaust” air is directed are crucial considerations in most stack ventilation designs.

At times, hybrid or the mixed-mode of ventilation also can be used and the natural forces of wind can be enhanced by the use of fans. A good design harmonizes the existing winds with the proposed airflow pattern.

Step 3: The size and location of the openings should be adequate, so that the essential ventilation rates can be provided under all functional ways. This can be assured in the following three way process.

 Initially, the desired rates of ventilation need to be determined as mentioned in the infection control requirements.   
 Then, the size and location of the openings need to be fixed so as to deliver the determined rates under the design conditions.   
 Lastly, to maintain a steady, unobstructed flow under changing weather and habitation conditions, a control system needs to be designed.

Some strategies that can be useful at the design stage and renovation stage to make the building air borne infection control compliant are discussed further.

# II. Site Planning

Site planning includes studying the location of the site, the prevailing wind direction and available outdoor space surrounding the building. The wards where patients with infectious diseases will be admitted should be placed away from other non-infectious wards. Maximum ventilation should be achieved by strategic positioning of open spaces for waiting areas, including registration areas, OPD, and any areas queues are likely to form—outside the pharmacy, the laboratory, radiology .

# III. Building Geometry

Building shape: The shape of the building should be designed to maximize natural ventilation. Naturally ventilated buildings need to be broader on the façade which receives air so as to aid maximum air capture into the building (longer, narrower plans perform better).

Air direction: If possible, the air entering the structure should be directed from non-infectious part of the building to the areas more likely to have infectious patients such as the waiting room, OPD or medicine wards to ensure no potentially infectious air is circulated in the space. REMEMBER: It is the undiagnosed patient with TB who poses the greatest risk of transmitting to others.

Design of Corridor: After carefully understanding the flow of air on the site, windward side should be identified. The ideal construction is with a single corridor connecting rooms and acting as transit space for the building. The corridor must be built with multiple large windows opening in and out on both sides—to the exterior and to the rooms. The windows must NOT be SLIDING windows. Wind will then enter the building through the windows in the corridor and flow into the rooms, ensuring that the wind blows from the clean area outside and dilutes the air in the rooms or wards.

Figure 1

Example: Single corridor running in front of rooms acting as connector and transit space (Fig. 1).

Design of courtyard: Courtyard is a vernacular strategy for warm and humid climatic zone. This design strategy helps the wind to enter the building..

Example: Strategic location of the courtyard to optimize the air velocity (Fig. 2).

![](images/91f30cc07c31cebf147311776421dae537b039d6dcadacccacba5e4ee185be38.jpg)  
Figure 2

Design of the rooms: The rooms and corridors should be designed so that total amount of openings per room is equal to or exceeds $2 0 \%$ of the area of room to ensure maximum dilution of air in the room.

 Color & Surface designing: The color and the finishes of the surfaces must also be chosen properly for a comfortable level of lighting and glare control as the heat reflection also plays a part in cooling or heating of the interior of the building.

 Height: The height of the rooms must be a minimum 3M clear or more. This shall help for better dilution of air in the room enhancing dilution of air. Use higher spaces in waiting areas when possible.

\`Location of windows: Windows should be placed on opposite walls to ensure cross ventilation wherever possible. Placing the windows at lower level at the source of the air flow and placing windows at the higher end on opposite wall can make sure that the air is moving through the space. (Fig.3).

![](images/102cd7b77fb633ccff4cfea24c171d56d2ae57075e04c3bb60ce0381d3d93a2c.jpg)  
Figure 3

 Type of windows: The windows designed in natural ventilated areas of the facility shall be made outward or inward opening type, NOT sliding. This will ensure that the openings provided are utilized to the optimum for ventilation. (Fig. 4)

![](images/d786005561825b2ae0de5294db15f702c35b73d74925c669a680371b7d61cdaa.jpg)  
Figure 4

Transoms: Ventilation windows or transoms shall be provided on top of all the doors and windows to enable potential infectious air in the facility to escape. These transoms should be kept open, openable type, louvered or sash. Fixed glass transoms should not be used. (Fig. 5)

Figure 5

Shading: Shading can modify the air currents in the space. Blinds, overhangs and projections (including deep window reveals) can be used. Self-shading by the building itself and shading by another building or trees may also work if properly considered. Retractable external blinds can be used to shade and expose the façade of the structure depending on the desired direction of the air. (Fig. 6)

Figure 6

# 5. Design Elements

The following are the considerations for planning the interior layout of a health care facility:

I. Outside Waiting area: REMEMBER: It is the undiagnosed TB patient who poses the highest risk of transmission

Any open area outside the facility should be utilized as patient waiting areas wherever available. In an outside waiting area, there is a free flow of air which dilutes potentially infected air to make it less infectious and reduce the risk of air borne spread to other patients in the waiting area.

The outside area should be shaded to protect patients from both rain and sun (Fig.7). Activities such as registration, waiting areas, medicine dispensing and queuing for laboratory specimen drop off can be extended to the outside areas.

![](images/112743bba8d95b73648a8adfa311194e338d0d4c0c54324898b7b1e90eeb02ca.jpg)  
Figure 7: Outside waiting area with shed and seating arrangement for patients

# II. Windows and Ventilators (or Transoms)

# a. Windows

Windows and doors should be checked to assure they are in proper position to allow for the free, unencumbered movement of air (e.g., across room, from window to door or vice versa)

The above two measures would ensure adequate ventilation.

The windows should open on hinges, outside/ inside opening and NOT use sliding panels (Fig. 8). Sliding window panels cut ventilation by $5 0 \%$ .

![](images/be8c6b84db0177574fe5fe5d0d2a8dd0bc44feba6959e5ef71c0c3aefa77851b.jpg)  
Figure 8: Outward/Inward opening windows allowing $100 \%$ utilization of the inlet for air flow

# b. Ventilators

Provision of ventilators or transoms should be made above the windows and doors (Fig.9). This would expedite the air circulation inside the room as these ventilators help the infected warm air to escape the room and that space could be filled with fresh air from the windows and doors.

![](images/15931f18ef19c77027197fee95fec19cbc62641f4ed90c111382f955fe1e2493.jpg)  
Figure 9: Correct location and openable type of ventilators

# c. Grills and Mesh

The opening in the facility can be enclosed with grills to stop animals from entering the facility (Fig.10). Solid partition like glass and dense wire mesh should be avoided as they obstruct air and light from entering the space.

Windows of pharmacy, registration, DOTS center, sputum collection windows should be un-obstructed. Grills can be used that allow air to pass through

![](images/7cc3470e820f11043bdcccc751a960ea2f30b61ba0b3cc50d7bebacaa435d3a8.jpg)  
Figure 10: Types of grills that can be used

# III. Internal Walls

The internal walls of the rooms in health care facility should be of lesser height than the height of the ceiling to maximize air circulation (Fig.11). The partition should protect privacy. The gap formed between the ceiling and partition should be at least $6 0 ~ \mathrm { c m s }$ .

![](images/c4b20741f189b27e29882fb94d9f1a694a20fdd30ca27fc509ca0474be9f8703.jpg)  
Figure 11: Types of internal wall partition

If mosquitos, birds or pest infestation occurs, appropriate size mesh or grills can be installed at the top part of the wall so that, air continues to circulate in the space.

# IV. Ceiling and Roof

The ceiling should be as high as possible to facilitate the rise of warm air above the human height. This will help remove contaminated air through the ventilators (transoms) or exhausts. False or dropped ceilings should not be built, as they reduce the effective height of the space and restrict the rise of warm air. In cases where false ceilings already exist and cannot be easily removed, some of the panels should be opened. This will create a space for the warm and infected air to rise above the inhabited space and allow replacement by fresh air (Fig.12).

![](images/a421ba10eec820800ee4410555b3a429976ab7e4b0c075ce45e9a82f1cee1c27.jpg)  
Figure 12: Different types of ceilings and roof

# V. Seating Arrangements

# a. Seating Arrangement in Health Facility Rooms

The positioning of health care workers in a room should allow the air to flow from the health care worker to the patient so that potentially infectious air from a patient coughing or sneezing does not infect the health care worker. If this arrangement is not possible a compromise would be to arrange the health care worker’s table/desk parallel to the air flow. Directional control of air flow can be achieved with the use of exhaust fans, wall mounted fans or propeller fans, but there is a limit to what these fans can achieve in diminishing transmission of infectious particles.

# b. Seating Arrangement in waiting areas

Seating in the waiting area should avoid overcrowding and additional seating should be provided outside using a number system. Patients should not be permitted to stand at the entrance to waiting areas. Seats should be installed facing away from each other so as to prevent cross infection amongst the patients (Fig.13).
