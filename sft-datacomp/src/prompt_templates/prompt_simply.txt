## Setup
- source_data_path = {/mnt/DataFlow/djz/Biology/Agriculture/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture_testoutput/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture/auto/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture.md}
- output_path = {/mnt/DataFlow/djz/Biology/Agriculture/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture_testoutput/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture/auto/Lecture_Note_on_Agriculture_codex_qa.json}

## Task Objective

You will be responsible for creating high-quality instruction-response training data.



**Output Path** = {output_path}

**Task Objective**:

* Source Data Path = {source_data_path}
* Read and understand the content of the markdown file.
* Construct high-quality instruction-response pairs from the markdown content.
* Save the generated data in JSONL format to: {output_path}

Each line of the JSONL file should include the following fields:

* `"instruction"` (training data question): string type
* `"response"` (training data answer): string type

## Basic Rules

* Only the content in the markdown file can be used as the factual basis.
* If a detail is not found in the markdown file, do not include it as a fact.

## Restrictions (Important)

1. **No Internet Access:**

   * Internet browsing is prohibited.
   * External documents, websites, or knowledge bases cannot be used.
   * Model API calls are allowed, but the generated content must be based solely on the markdown file.

2. **Working Directory Rules:**

   * Operations are only permitted within the current working directory and its subdirectories.
   * Only markdown files from the following path may be read:
     {source_data_path}
   * Outputs can only be written to the following path:
     {output_path}

## Output Requirements

* Extract content from the source file multiple times to generate high-quality instruction-response data.

Please note: All actions will be performed without user interaction. Ensure that the final JSONL file is written once all processes are completed.
